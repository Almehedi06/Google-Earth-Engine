## Project Overview

This project leverages the power of **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** for processing large amounts of satellite imagery and performing environmental monitoring, including:
- **Flood Mapping**: Identifying areas impacted by flooding events using time-series satellite imagery.
- **Land Cover Classification**: Detecting and classifying land cover types such as urban, forest, water, and agriculture using machine learning techniques and NDVI calculations.

Scripts in this repository are designed to help researchers and data scientists perform accurate geospatial analysis and develop environmental solutions.

## Technologies

The following technologies and tools are used in this project:
- **Google Earth Engine**: Cloud-based platform for planetary-scale environmental data analysis.
- **JavaScript**: For GEE script writing and execution.
- **Python**: For post-processing and integration with machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning**: Applied for land cover classification and environmental analysis using GEE and Python.
- **Sentinel-1/2 & Landsat-8**: Satellite data sources used for flood mapping and land cover analysis.

## Data Sources

- **Sentinel-1 SAR Data**: Used for flood mapping due to its ability to capture data during all weather conditions.
- **Sentinel-2 Multispectral Data**: Used for land cover classification and NDVI calculations.
- **Landsat-8**: Provides historical multispectral data for long-term land cover analysis.
